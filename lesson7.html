**Mental State Check (Interactive):**
> **Select your role and rate your emotional response to this scenario:**
> - [ ] Sales Associate  
> - [ ] Cashier  
> - [ ] Manager  
> 
> Rate on a scale of 1-5 how stressed you'd feel in this scenario and reflect: Why?

**Psychology of Pressure:**
- Learn to manage fight-or-flight.
- Your response matters more than your logic.
